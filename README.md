# K-Nearest-Neighbors
 It is a classification problem for categorizing the customers based on service usage patterns, focuses on using demographic data, such as region, age, and marital, to predict usage patterns.
 The target field, called custcat, has four possible values that correspond to the four customer groups, as follows: 1- Basic Service 2- E-Service 3- Plus Service 4- Total Service. Our objective is to build a classifier, to predict the class of unknown cases. We will use a specific type of classification called K nearest neighbour.
